# Image_Captioning Using LSTM

## Dataset - Flickr_8K
<ul>
  <li>In Flickr_8K dataset, all the images of training, validation and test set are in one folder.</li>
  <li>It contains 3 different files i.e <em>Flickr_8k.trainImages.txt</em>,<em>Flickr_8k.testImages.txt</em>,     <em>Flickr_8k.devImages.txt</em> corresponding to each type of dataset i.e train, test and validation set, each file having file_name of images conatined in each dataset.</li>
  <li>Each image is given 5 different captions by 5 different humans. This is because an image can be described in multiple ways.These captions are stored in <em>'Flickr8k.token.txt'</em>.</li>
</ul>

## Model
<b>ResNet50</b> was used as an image encoder to encode the images which were then input in the model.<br>
<b>Keras embedding layer</b> was used to generate word embeddings on the captions which were encoded earlier.<br>
The embeddings were then passed into <b>LSTM</b> after which the image and text features were combined and sent to a decoder network
to generate the next word.<br>

## Results
<b>Greedy Search</b> and <b>Beam Search</b> both were used to generate the captions.<br>
<b>Bleu Score</b> was used to evaluate the captions generated.
### Captions generated by Greedy Search are as follows:
